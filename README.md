# Iconifier
An open-source python-pure program that allows text iconification!

## How to use?
Open the EXE, insert an emoji's name, insert some text and voila!

Example of usage:

Emoji: `cheese_wedge`

Text: `Cheesehead`

Styling: First

## Extra info
Cheesehead (me): 50% of the program

ChatGPT: The other 50% of the program

Current version: 1.3

## TODO
* [x] ~~Add the ability to paste from the windows emoji picker~~ Add the ability to type in the name of the emoji from the emoji library
* [x] Make a (slightly) better UI
