# Iconifier
An open-source python-pure program that allows text iconification!

## How to use?
Open the EXE, insert an emoji (copy from somewhere, inserting from the windows emoji picker won't work), insert a text and voila!

## Extra info
Cheesehead (me): 50% of the program

ChatGPT: The other 50% of the program

## TODO
* [ ] Add the ability to paste from the windows emoji picker
* [ ] Make a better UI
