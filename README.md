## TODO
* [x] ~~Add the ability to paste from the windows emoji picker~~ Add the ability to type in the name of the emoji from the [emoji overview](https://carpedm20.github.io/emoji/ "See the emoji overview here!!")
* [x] Make a better UI

## sadge
The development of this version is slowing down because i have no idea of what to add

I dont want to make this paid, i will NEVER make anything paid

With that said, i think you should start using [this same program, but as a CLI](https://github.com/error4OA/iconifier-console-mode/releases "Iconifier, without GUI")
